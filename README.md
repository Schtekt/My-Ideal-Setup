# My Ideal Setup

This repo shows off an exampple of the setup I would use for a C++ project. This may be extended in the future to support Linux environments as well, but for now it only covers Windows.

To be able to build the dummy program, three things are necessary.

* **Visual studio code** (Can be found here https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

* **MSBuild**, this can be obtained with ["Build tools for visual studio"](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe). Make sure to add MSBuild to PATH.

* **Premake5**, can be downloaded from the premake [website](https://premake.github.io/). Make sure to add it to PATH.
